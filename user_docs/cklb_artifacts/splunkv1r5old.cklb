These should not be used in any production environment.\n\nIt is also recommended that the production certificates be stored in another location away from the Splunk default certificates, as that folder gets replaced on any upgrade of the application. An example would be to use a folder named /etc/system/DoDcerts under the Splunk installation root folder.","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","legacy_ids":[],"ccis":["CCI-002470"],"reference_identifier":"5447","uuid":"26da02f4-0fd2-4388-a51f-54398e25df83","stig_uuid":"fb922f59-a126-4344-b97f-fafccd57f5a5","status":"not_a_finding","overrides":{},"comments":"","finding_details":""},{"group_id_src":"V-251691","group_tree":[{"id":"V-251691","title":"SRG-APP-000439-AU-004310","description":"<GroupDescription></GroupDescription>"}],"group_id":"V-251691","severity":"high","group_title":"Splunk Enterprise must be configured to protect the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted information.","rule_id_src":"SV-251691r879810_rule","rule_id":"SV-251691r879810","rule_version":"SPLK-CL-000460","rule_title":"Splunk Enterprise must be configured to protect the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted information.","fix_text":"Edit the following files in the installation to configure Splunk to use SSL certificates:\n\nThis configuration is performed on the machine used as an indexer, which may be a separate machine in a distributed environment.\n\n$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/inputs.conf\n\n[splunktcp-ssl:9997]\ndisabled = 0\n\n[SSL]\nserverCert = <path to the DoD approved certificate in PEM format>\nsslPassword = <password for the certificate>\n\nThis configuration is performed on the machine used as a forwarder, which is always a separate machine regardless of environment.\n\n$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/outputs.conf\n\n[tcpout:group1]\ndisabled = 0\nclientCert = <path to the DoD approved certificate in PEM format>\nsslPassword = <password for the certificate>","weight":"10.0","check_content":"Check the following files in the installation to verify Splunk uses SSL certificates for communication between the indexer and the forwarder:\n\nThis check is performed on the machine used as an indexer, which may be a separate machine in a distributed environment.\n\n$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/inputs.conf\n\n[splunktcp-ssl:9997]\ndisabled = 0\n\n[SSL]\nserverCert = <path to the DoD approved certificate in PEM format>\nsslPassword = <password for the certificate>\n\nIf these settings are misconfigured, this is a finding.\n\nThis configuration is performed on the machine used as a forwarder, which is always a separate machine regardless of environment.\n\n$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/outputs.conf\n\n[tcpout:group1]\ndisabled = 0\nclientCert = <path to the DoD approved certificate in PEM format>\nsslPassword = <password for the certificate>\n\nIf these settings are misconfigured, this is a finding.","check_content_ref":{"href":"U_Splunk_Enterprise_8-x_for_Linux_STIG_V1R5_Manual-xccdf.xml","name":"M"},"classification":"Unclassified","discussion":"Without protection of the transmitted information, confidentiality and integrity may be compromised since unprotected communications can be intercepted and either read or altered. \n\nThis requirement applies only to those applications that are either distributed or can allow access to data non-locally.
