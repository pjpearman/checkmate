If local administrator accounts on domain systems are sharing a password, this is a finding.\n\nIt is highly recommended to use Microsoft's Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS), which provides an automated solution for maintaining and regularly changing a local administrator password for domain-joined systems. LAPS can manage a single local administrator account. The default is the built-in administrator account; however, it can be configured to manage an administrator account of a different name. If additional local administrator accounts exist across systems, the organization must have a process to require unique passwords on each system for the additional accounts.\n\nThe AO may approve other automated solutions that provide this capability.\n\nIf LAPS has been installed and enabled in the domain, the following PowerShell query will return a list of systems that do not have a local administrator password managed by LAPS. (The LAPS PowerShell module requires PowerShell 2.0 or higher and .NET Framework 4.0.)\n\nOpen \"Windows PowerShell\".\nIf the LAPS PowerShell module has not been previously imported, execute the following first: \"Import-Module AdmPwd.ps\".\nExecute \"Get-AdmPwdPassword -ComputerName * | Where-object {$_.password -eq $null}\"\n\nReview the returned list for validity.\n\nExclude computers with \"OU=Domain Controllers\" in the DistinguishedName field.  Other possible exceptions include but are not limited to non-Windows computers in Active Directory.\n\nIf any active/deployed Windows systems that are not managed by another process to ensure unique passwords for local administrator accounts are listed, this is a finding.\n\nIf the query fails, the organization must demonstrate that passwords for local administrator accounts are properly managed to ensure unique passwords for each. If not, this is a finding.",

However, it is possible for an administrator to change this setting or the trust may have been created in an older version of AD. \n\nSID filtering causes SID references that do not refer to the directly trusted domain or forest to be removed from inbound access requests in the trusting domain. Without SID filtering, access requests could contain spoofed SIDs, permitting unauthorized access.  \n\nIn cases where access depends on SID history or Universal Groups, failure to enable SID filtering could result in operational problems, including denial of access to authorized users.\n\nWhen the quarantine switch is applied to external or forest trusts, only those SIDs from the single, directly trusted domain are valid.
