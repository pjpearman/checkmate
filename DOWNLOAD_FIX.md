# Download Functionality Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
The TUI "Download STIGs > Fetch file list from URL" was failing with the error:
```
Status: Download list error: 'WebDownloader' object has no attribute 'get_available_files'
```

## Root Cause
The TUI and GUI were calling non-existent methods on the WebDownloader class:
- `get_available_files()` - doesn't exist
- `download_all()` - doesn't exist  
- `download_from_url(url)` - doesn't exist

## Fixes Applied

### 1. TUI Download Methods Fixed
**File: `/workspaces/checkmate/tui/main.py`**

- **`fetch_download_list()`**: Now uses `get_available_stigs()` instead of `get_available_files()`
- **`download_all_files()`**: Now uses `download_multiple_files()` with proper file links format
- **`download_specific_types()`**: Enhanced with STIG categorization logic
- **`view_downloaded_files()`**: Added file size calculation and human-readable formatting

### 2. GUI Download Methods Fixed  
**File: `/workspaces/checkmate/gui/main.py`**

- **`run_download_task()`**: Enhanced to use `get_available_stigs()` and `download_multiple_files()`
- Added proper progress tracking and error handling
- Added success/failure counting and reporting

### 3. Actual WebDownloader Methods Available
**File: `/workspaces/checkmate/core/web.py`**

The WebDownloader class provides these methods:
- `get_available_stigs()` - Get list of available STIG files
- `download_multiple_files()` - Download multiple files with progress tracking
- `download_file()` - Download a single file
- `fetch_page()` - Fetch HTML content from URL
- `parse_table_for_links()` - Parse download links from HTML

## Testing Results

✅ **All download functionality now works correctly**
- TUI can fetch STIG file lists without errors
- TUI can download all available files
- GUI can download STIGs with progress tracking
- Both interfaces provide proper error handling and status updates

## Features Enhanced

### TUI Download Features:
- **Fetch file list**: Gets available STIGs from DISA website
- **Download all files**: Downloads all available STIGs with progress
- **Download specific types**: Categorizes STIGs by type (OS, Applications, Network)
- **View downloaded files**: Shows file count and total size

### GUI Download Features:
- **Enhanced file dialog**: Better error handling and progress tracking
- **Multiple file download**: Batch download with success/failure reporting
- **Real-time status**: Progress updates during download
- **Automatic refresh**: File lists updated after download

## Usage

### TUI:
```bash
python checkmate.py tui
# Navigate to: Download STIGs → Fetch file list from URL
```

### GUI:
```bash
python checkmate.py gui  
# Go to: Download tab → Download STIGs button
```

Both interfaces now correctly interact with the WebDownloader's actual API and provide robust download functionality.
